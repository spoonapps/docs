### from

The `from` instruction creates a new container and sets the base image(s) for that container. 

```
from <image>
```

A valid `.me` file must start with a `from` instruction and may only contain one from instruction. 

Multiple images can be specified in a single `from` instruction by putting a space between subsequent images. If two images contains the same file - first one is taken. Always ensure that images with new versions of applications/libraries are passed first. Virtual machine settings are taken from last image in the list.

```
from <image 1> <image 2>

# Start container with git and node
from spoonbrew/git spoonbrew/node
```

**Note**: To initialize an empty container, use the `spoonbrew/scratch` image

```
from spoonbrew/scratch
```
